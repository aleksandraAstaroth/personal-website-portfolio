        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Aleksandra Rzepecka. I’m front-end developer student based in Stockholm. 
            I got very inquisitive mind, that means constant quesioning, analysing and looking at the process from different perspectives.<br/> 
            <br/>
            Here’s where I should get to the point, list out my skills and show off my work...
            I promise. I WILL get there...<br/>
            <br/>
            BUT, first thing that you should know about me - I am a big-picture thinker.<br/>
            <br/>
            It all starts with the mindset. I want to give you an insight into HOW I think, WHAT actions I take, and WHY I do it this way.<br/>
            <br/> 
            There’s a glimpse of my background that shaped me, so that it can help you get a sense of what kind of person I am:<br/>
            <ul>
            <li>I grew up in Poland.</li>
            <li>As a teenager I became licenced glider pilot.</li>
            <li>I came to Sweden 5 years ago, on my own, with a plan and money... that I haven’t had.</li>
            <li>I woked in different environments. I started out in retail. I also worked various fast-pace service jobs in the restaurant industry. And my latest position I’ve had,  before starting my frontend education, was a dog walker/caretaker at the dog day care.</li>
            <li>I’ve also enjoyed exploring new exciting ways of self-expression. During that time as a hobby I practiced mixing techno music, which resulted in a few dj gigs around Stockholm.</li>
            <li>I also modelled for a few internationally recognized alternative clothing brands when I was growing my social media reach through collaborations. Along with that, I picked up interest in photography and photo editing using Adobe programs.</li>
            </ul>
            ... Where am I going with it ? Please, bear with me, I am getting there! <br/><br/>

            Experimenting with creative softwares has led me to becoming <span>obsessed</span> passionate about coding and development, which allows me to create new value utilising already gained skills/perspectives/experiences as contributions to new solutions-
            depending on a given problem.<br/> 
            ...Afterall, during debugging process, when feeling stuck, what is most effective approach? <br/>
            Taking a step back and looking at the problem from different perspective.<br/><br/>

            Upon getting an insight into my experiences, it should be easier to tie other traits into the picture.<br/>
            Each experience has taught me something valuable that helped me in other settings, but in a different form.<br/><br/>
            Taking chances and calculating risks, required resourcefullness, flexibility and adaptation to new situations. 
            <br/>
            Deep diving head-first into new settings was always conscious choice of forcing my development and challenging myself in unknown areas. <br/>
            <br/>
            My extroverted nature of a curious kid plays probably the biggest role; through socialising, empathy, and A LOT OF QUESTIONS (yes, I am THAT person) I got to learn new things and understand different perspectives - see the bigger picture, analyse it, and look for opportunities. 
            There is always something new that I can learn from others and get inspired to improve my own skills.  Networking and asking for guidance were necessary to build up my life from scratch and progress.<br/>
            <br/>
            Trying to see the value of the process itself, looking deeper into it and not only the end result.
            I believe that base for working towards sustainable and effective solutions  during development process is established already during The Thinking Process through
            multidimensionally analysing the problem to understand it, estimate the scope, and from there work towards solution by utilising knowledge, skills and creativity.<br/>
