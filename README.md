##  Personal Website - Portfolio

 This repository contains source code for my personal website / front-end developer portfolio, giving a visitor an idea of what kind of person I am, as well as  showcases my projects. Aside from a role of Personal Project for Hyper Island FED22 course, it's meant to serve as my personal website for professional purposes.
 
 Design inspired by mix of VHS style 80s with high-tech Cyberpunk aesthetic. Full of neon lights and glitches, which is by now my signature style :sweat_smile:
